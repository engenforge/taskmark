## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-11-08

### Added
- `tm list`, `tm add`, `tm done`, and `tm move` for editing tasks from the command line, addressed by short handles derived from each task's text.
- `tm init --orphan [BRANCH]` and `tm sync` to keep task files on a separate Git branch mounted at `.tasks/`.
- Rule V14 reports leftover frontmatter in pre-0.4 files; `tm validate --fix` removes it.

### Changed
- **Specification (SPEC-TASKMARK-04):** task files are pure CommonMark with no frontmatter; hub-and-spoke concepts removed.
- Rule V13 requires a blank line between a task (or its payload) and following prose.
- Default task directory is `.tasks/` (was `doc/tasks/`, still used when it is the only one present).
- `completed.tm.md` and archive files are newest first; sweeps bucket under `## YYYY-MM`, or `## Sprint <id>` with `tm sweep --sprint <id>`.
- `tm archive` keeps the 2 newest sections in `completed.tm.md` (was 10).
- Commands that modify task files lock the task directory, so concurrent runs no longer lose updates.

### Removed
- `tm rotate` (use `tm sweep --sprint <id>`).
- Rules V1/V2 and the unused hub configuration keys.

### Fixed
- A failed write never replaces a task file, and concurrent writers no longer share a temp file.
- `tm validate --fix` preserves CRLF line endings.
- Symlinked task files keep their link when rewritten.
- The installed `VERSION` file is readable by all users.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-27

### Changed
- **Grammar Relaxation (SPEC-TASKMARK-03):**
  - **Rule V6 (Prose Lists):** Relaxed to permit top-level prose bullet lists (`*`, `+`) and ordered lists (`1.`) alongside standard tasks.
  - **Rule V8 (Payload Sub-lists):** Relaxed to allow sub-lists (indented 2 spaces relative to list items) and hanging continuation lines within active task payloads.
  - **Rule V10 (Multi-line Labeled Fields):** Relaxed to allow multi-line labeled fields using continuation lines prefixed with `    > `.
- **Auto-Repair Engine:** Updated `tm validate --fix` to normalize loose bullets and legacy Unicode `•` bullets to `*`, while preserving valid sub-lists and multi-line labeled fields without flattening.
- Updated specification ([`doc/taskmark_spec.md`](doc/taskmark_spec.md)), man pages ([`doc/tm.1.scd`](doc/tm.1.scd)), and tests to reference `SPEC-TASKMARK-03`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-27

### Added
- **Validation Auto-Repair:** Introduced `tm validate --fix` to automatically repair common formatting inconsistencies (e.g. indentation, loose bullet styles).
- **Batch Validation:** Permitted `tm validate` to accept multiple file arguments in a single invocation.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-02

### Changed
- **Specification Migration (SPEC-TASKMARK-02):**
  - Standardized task file extension to `.tm.md` (`active.tm.md`, `future.tm.md`, `completed.tm.md`).
  - Migrated frontmatter from fenced JSON to a flat `key: value` subset (YAML-compatible) delimited by `---`.
  - Replaced section-level sprint rotation with task-level sweep (`tm sweep`) and sprint rollover (`tm rotate`).
  - Enforced a strict 4-space payload indentation rule aligned with list item content.
- **Pure Lua Single-Pass Scanner:** Introduced `src/tmscan.lua` to classify document lines in a single pass without building an AST or retaining whole files in memory.
- **Zero-Dependency Runtime:** Removed runtime AST parsing dependencies (`cmark-lua` / `dkjson.lua`). Lua C bindings are retained solely for the test suite's CommonMark oracle (`tests/commonmark_test.lua`).
- **Configuration Hierarchy:** Introduced two-file, per-key configuration resolution across global (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/taskmark/config`) and local (`.taskmarkrc`) config files.
- **Payload Filters:** Added `tm indent` and `tm dedent` payload filter subcommands for clean shell and scripting integration.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **Universal CLI (`tm`):** Introduced the installable `tm` command-line dispatcher with subcommands for `validate`, `sweep`, `rotate`, `archive`, and `init`.
- **System Installation:** Added `Makefile` targets for `install`, `uninstall`, and reproducible release packaging (`make dist`, `make dist-bin`).
- **Documentation:** Added `tm(1)` manual page authored in `scdoc` with roff generation.
- **Standards Adaptation:** Adapted `todo.txt` metadata conventions (priority flags `(A)`, tags `+project`, contexts `@context`, and due dates `due:YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Archive Automation:** Automated aging of completed sprint sections into `archive/<YYYY>/<YYYY-MM>.tm.md`.
